                house, is immensely rewarding. It's a tangible representation of
                your patience and dedication, perfect for displaying in your

            Step-by-Step Guide to Build a Miniature House

            <div class="details-box-content">
              <h4>Step 1: Unbox and Organize Your Kit</h4>
              <p>
                Start by carefully unpacking your kit and laying out all the
                materials. Check the instruction manual to ensure all components
                are included. Group similar items together for easy access
                during assembly.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 2: Build the House Structure</h4>
              <p>
                Assemble the main frame of the house using the pre-cut wooden
                pieces. Follow the instructions closely, using glue to secure
                the walls, floors, and roof. Allow adequate time for the glue to
                dry before moving to the next step.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 3: Paint and Decorate</h4>
              <p>
                Before adding furniture and decor, paint the house and any
                structural details like doors and windows. Use the included
                paints or your own for customization. Let the paint dry
                completely before proceeding.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 4: Assemble the Furniture</h4>
              <p>
                Put together the miniature furniture and accessories. These may
                include beds, shelves, plants, and even tiny books. Use tweezers
                to handle small parts with precision.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 5: Add Lighting</h4>
              <p>
                If your kit includes LED lights, carefully follow the wiring
                instructions to install them. Lights are often placed in
                ceilings, walls, or lamps for a realistic effect.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 6: Decorate the Interior</h4>
              <p>
                Place the furniture and decorative items inside the house
                according to your vision. Use glue to secure them if necessary.
                This is your chance to get creative and make the space uniquely
                yours.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 7: Final Touches</h4>
              <p>
                Once everything is in place, double-check the stability of the
                components. Add any final decorative elements, like curtains,
                rugs, or tiny photo frames.
              </p>
              <h4>Step 8: Display Your Masterpiece</h4>
              <p>
                Your miniature house is now ready! Display it proudly on a
                shelf, desk, or in a glass case to protect it from dust.
